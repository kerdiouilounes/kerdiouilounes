- 👋 Hi, I’m @kerdiouilounes
- 👀 I’m interested in Developping E-commerce APPs Especially for Android
- 🌱 I’m currently building a complex E-Commerce Project That consist of 4+ Android Apps using Flutter : 
 - one for Project Administrators to control all the other Apps.
 - one for Stores, where each store belongs to a major category, and every store can upload its products images and data in order to display them in the Users(Clients) App.
 - one for Users(Clients), where they can search and navigate through subscribed stores products and they can order from these products by selecting a delivery method and payement method
 - one for Delivery Companies, where each Delivery Company has its account where they can manage orders of users if they where selected by users in selecting a delivery method
 - and about 3 more apps related to this project (i want to keep them secret).
 ... this was a mini description on my current -onWorking- project that has been planned carefully and based on large research about the market needs.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a large company or a startup that has long term plan for developing E-commerce Apps and has the same point-vue as mine.
- 📫  i will be happy if you contact me in the following E-mail adresse : kerdiouimilounes@gmail.com
